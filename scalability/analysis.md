# Standardization Issues

The "Interoperability Failures" graph directly addresses standardization challenges:

- **Hybrid Conflicts** : This is by far the most dominant interoperability failure, indicating significant issues when quantum and classical protocols, data formats, or control mechanisms clash. This highlights a severe lack of shared standards or well-defined interfaces for hybrid network operations.
- **Classical→Quantum** : There is a notable failure rate when classical nodes attempt to interact with quantum nodes. This could be due to incompatible signaling, data representation, or control plane differences that haven't been standardized.
- **Quantum→Classical** : Similarly, communication attempts from quantum to classical nodes also experience failures, though slightly less frequently than classical to quantum. This again points to a lack of clear and agreed-upon standards for seamless transition and translation between quantum and classical domains.

# **Bottlenecks for scaling up :**

### Horizontal Scaling (Increasing the Number of Nodes/Instances)

Horizontal scaling in this hybrid quantum-classical network would involve increasing the number of nodes (both classical and quantum-capable) and links. The graphs highlight several issues with this approach:

- **Degrading Quantum Communication Success**: As the network size (number of nodes) increases, the probability of successful end-to-end communication remains at or near zero. Thus adding more nodes does not improve, and in fact severely hinders, reliable quantum links.

- **Routing Complexity Escalation**: With more nodes, the "Routing Table Size" significantly increases, especially beyond 20 nodes. Thus managing routes across a larger number of interconnected nodes becomes computationally more intensive and resource-demanding.

- **Increased Setup Time**: The "Setup Time" for the network also increases with the number of nodes, meaning that initializing or reconfiguring a larger network takes more time.

- **Connectivity Degradation**: After 40 nodes, "Connectivity Degradation" occurs. In a horizontally scaled network, simply adding more nodes doesn't guarantee robust connectivity. It may lead to a less reliable network topology with potential for isolated segments or decreased overall reachability.

### Vertical Scaling (Increasing Capacity of Individual Nodes/Links)

Vertical scaling, in this context, would involve enhancing the capabilities of individual nodes (e.g., more processing power, larger memory for routing tables, better quantum hardware with longer coherence times) or improving the quality of individual links (e.g., reducing signal loss, increasing entanglement distribution success). While the graphs don't directly show vertical scaling, we can infer its importance based on the observed bottlenecks:

- **Decoherence and Qubit Loss**: Each quantum link has a probability of 'qubit loss' over distance". Vertical scaling of quantum nodes and links would ideally address this by improving qubit coherence times or developing more robust quantum memory, which is crucial given the current near-zero quantum communication success rate.

- **Routing Performance**: While horizontal scaling increases routing table size, vertical scaling of classical nodes could involve more powerful processors and memory to handle larger routing tables and process complex routing protocols more efficiently, mitigating the "Routing Complexity Threshold".

- **Interoperability Solution**: Vertical scaling could also involve developing more sophisticated protocol translation capabilities within individual hybrid nodes to better handle "protocol mismatches" and "lack of shared standards" identified as major interoperability issues
